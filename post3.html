                With the growing popularity of AI-generated art platforms such as Midjourney and Stability AI, this essay explores their implications for our understanding of art. AI-generated art is created through neural networks trained on large datasets, producing works across diverse disciplines such as music, poetry, and visual art. Unlike traditional art or even other digital artforms like CGI, AI-generated art relies primarily on inputs, reducing the human role in its creation to prompts and selection. This essay examines the historical evolution of art, from traditional oil paintings to movements like Impressionism or Dadaism that challenged rigid definitions, and asks whether AI-generated works align with our modern understanding of art.

            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                In light of the first AI-generated work sold, I will analyze the AI-generated portrait titled Edmond de Bellamy, created by an AI-research group based in Sorbonne called Obvious. In 2019 the portrait was sold for $432,000 at a Christieâ€™s auction when its estimated value only amounted to about $10,000 solidifying an important landmark of AI-generated art infiltrating the fine arts (Hicks). There are three main points of criticism about this piece and its position within the intersections of art and technology:
                <ol>
                    <li>The creators borrowed code from others.</li>
                    <li>AI-generated art is not creative.</li>
                    <li>AI-generated art lacks human emotion.</li>
                </ol>
                    Despite these claims trying to dismantle the value of this piece, I will argue that it is a worthy representative of AI-generated art and that it can indeed more broadly be considered art.
                <ol>
                    <li>In the programming industry it is normal to borrow code.</li>
                    <li>True originality is not possible as there is nothing new under the sun.</li>
                    <li>The art process does not require human emotion in order for the viewer to derive meaning.</li>
                </ol>
                I will begin by explaining how GANs work before directly addressing each claim and then exploring the meaning or art itself.
