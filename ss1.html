                Typically, I stumble out onto the street around midday, bother the pretty waitress at the diner downstairs with my witty jokes, and then I'm off kicking around at the old Guitar Center. I don't mean to brag, but they worship me down there, even got my old band poster up in the breakroom. God those days were good. Fame, girls, and a good type of beat that makes you want to smash your head on the wall. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's been 23 years since the band broke up. I thought it was just another fight between Julian and Lex, they always bickered. But after Lex stormed off that night, we never could get them back in the same room. The two of them moved on to other bands and famously went head to head on the charts. But Jim and I? Well, we were kind of left behind. I was completely and utterly drained after we fell apart. I couldn't bear to pick up my sticks again without thinking about what we missed out on. I ran into Jim the other day, he's married with 2 kids. Nice wife. Big brown eyes. Reminded me of a doe. 
            </p>

                I ran into Fiona a few months back. She used to be obsessed with me. Drove all over the country following us on tour. I saw her in a convenience store in front of the ice cream freezer. Back then, it was easy to spot her amidst the crowd. She'd anchor herself to the edge of the stage and just stare at me the entire set. It was pretty weird. When she turned around, she stalled. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I got her to come out to the diner together. “So what's a rockstar like you been up to?” she asked with that old glaze over eyes. And then I realized something, I haven't been up to anything, definitely nothing a rockstar would be doing. I pretended I didn't hear her. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “So, what's your favorite one of our songs?” I asked, leaning back in the booth. She thought for a moment before responding, “Doe Eyes of course! I mean you wrote it about me didn't you? I used to think you guys were untouchable, I mean you were rockstars. But you'd always look right at me and that made me feel special.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                I froze. Unbelievable! Why is she making it seem like I was the one pining after her when it was the other way around! Jim wrote Doe Eyes for his girlfriend, there's no way I'd write it for some groupie. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “You know I'm not that surprised we ran into each other, you could never really forget me huh” she said. It must have been all that coke from those days that messed up her brain. I was tired of talking now so I walked her to her cab and then started home. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm pretty lonely these days. If you're a rockstar in your 40s and you're still single, you're either a legend or a loser. Yeah there've been a couple of chicks here and there, but they couldn't really know who I am without knowing who I was. “You were in a band? I've always had a thing for drummers! Could you play me something?” 
            </p>
            <p>
                They just don't understand, it wasn't just any band, alright. We were in Houston, Chicago, New York, and when we drank all the beer dry, we went to London. We spent days on the road, only stopping for gas and food. I'd pass time by trying to balance my drumstick on Lex's head while he napped, that sure pissed him off. Every day when I'm at the Guitar Center, they'd beg me to play, but I can't. Not without thinking back to the time when I had it all. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To these girls, I was just like just another character to check off their list, but I'm more than that, I swear I am, they'd just never get it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wow, I really haven't amounted to anything, this is kind of depressing. I walked back home and went straight to the dusty tin box I keep on my shelf. There it is, a beautiful shroom for a dogshit day. I lay back and close my eyes. I'm floating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything is black but under the spotlight is an elephant wearing a suit standing on its hind legs. “Benny, if you're stuck in the past you'll have no future. If you're always looking over your shoulder, you could trip on a pebble.” I also saw Jim doing cartwheels with his 10 kids on the beach. I couldn't tell if he was happy or miserable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I woke up the next day, got dressed, and headed to the diner as usual. I was walking down the street when someone screamed “Lex!” I whipped my head around and it was just another guy with the same name. I was turning my head back when all of a sudden my foot caught on something and I heard my head crack as I smacked into the sidewalk. I saw a pebble by my feet and a growing pool of blood. My eyes closed. I thought of that time when I accidentally broke Lex's speaker. Lex was furious by the way, he blamed Julian for it. Kept going on and on about how Julian never respected him, not just his things but his ideas, his contributions, etc. it wouldn't even matter when I told him it was me who broke it. I guess that was the last straw. That was the last night we were all together.
