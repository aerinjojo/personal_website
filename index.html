                <p>
                    I'm a junior at NYU Shanghai, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Humanities. Originally 
                    from Los Angeles, I've had the opportunity to live and study in cities across the globe, including Shanghai, 
                    Paris, and New York. My passion for exploring new places and cultures has shaped
                     me into someone who values adaptability, patience, and a genuine curiosity for the world around 
                     me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interests and skills span diverse areasâ€”from my early years in Junior PGA golfing and earning a 
                    certificate to teach piano, to building strong foundations in data structures, creative writing, 
                    and art history. These varied experiences give me a unique perspective that I bring to my work and 
                    projects, blending both analytical skills with a deep appreciation for creativity.
                </p>

                    I'm particularly drawn to statistical data analytics, where I see numbers as tools that can be used to tell stories. 
                    For me, data analytics is a blend of art and science. The idea of taking black and white data and transforming it into 
                    stories, tables, relationships, and all that drama, in order to make meaningful change is what inspires me most. 
                    Motivated by a commitment to learn for the sake of learning, I'm excited to continue exploring new ways to make an 
                    impact on the world through my work.
